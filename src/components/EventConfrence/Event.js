                        Roorkee alumnus started a dream,
                        GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming
                        excites you or you feel stifled,
                        wondering how to prepare for
                        interview questions or
                        how to ace data structures and
                        algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a
                        one-stop solution. With every
                        tick of time, we are adding arrows
                        in our quiver. From articles on
                        various computer science subjects
                        to programming problems for practice,
                        from basic to premium courses, from
                        technologies to entrance examinations,
                        we have been building ample content
                        with superior quality. In a short
                        span, we have built a community of
                        1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
                        Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors
                        in various colleges across the nation.
                        Our success stories include a lot of
                        students who benefitted in their
                        placements and landed jobs at tech
                        giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
                        network of geeks and we are only a
                        fraction of it yet.
