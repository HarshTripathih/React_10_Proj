                    Thankyou for showing interest,
                    here is a quick story of me and
                    this website. My programming
                    journey started back in 2019,
                    few months before I started
                    studying CSE in LPU Jalandhar.
                    I am currently in my third
                    year and doing Technical
                    Content Writing Internship
                    at GeeksForGeeks. I like
                    coding all kind of problems
                    from the very basic like adding
                    numbers to the complex ones like
                    competitive programming problems.
                    I love making projects and games.
